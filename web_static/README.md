## What is HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage and allows for embedding images, videos, and other media.

## How to create an HTML page

To create an HTML page, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
2. Create a new file and save it with a `.html` extension, e.g., `index.html`.
3. Add the basic HTML structure:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My AirBnB Clone</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My AirBnB Clone</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view it.

## What is a markup language

A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations specify how the content should be structured and presented. HTML is an example of a markup language.

## What is the DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to update the content, structure, and style of a document dynamically.

## What is an element / tag

An element is a component of an HTML page defined by a start tag and an end tag. For example, `<h1>Hello</h1>` is an element where `<h1>` is the start tag and `</h1>` is the end tag. Tags are used to create elements.

## What is an attribute

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs. For example, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">` has two attributes: `src` and `alt`.

## How does the browser load a webpage

When a browser loads a webpage, it follows these steps:

1. **Request**: The browser sends a request to the server hosting the webpage.
2. **Response**: The server sends back the HTML document.
3. **Parsing**: The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM.
4. **Rendering**: The browser applies CSS and executes JavaScript to render the page visually.
5. **Display**: The fully rendered page is displayed to the user.

## What is CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.

## How to add style to an element

You can add styles to an element in three ways:

1. **Inline CSS**: Use the `style` attribute directly in the HTML tag.

   ```html
   <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World</h1>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS**: Use a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section.

   ```html
   <style>
       h1 {
           color: blue;
       }
   </style>
   ```

3. **External CSS**: Link to an external stylesheet using the `<link>` tag.

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

## What is a class

A class in CSS is a selector that can be applied to multiple elements to style them in the same way. Classes are defined with a `.` (dot) prefix.

```css
.button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

You can apply this class to an HTML element as follows:

```html
<button class="button">Click Me</button>
```

## What is a selector

A selector is a pattern used to select the elements you want to style. Common types of selectors include:

- **Element Selector**: Selects elements by their tag name (e.g., `h1`).
- **Class Selector**: Selects elements with a specific class (e.g., `.button`).
- **ID Selector**: Selects an element with a specific ID (e.g., `#header`).

## How to compute CSS Specificity Value

CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple styles conflict. Specificity is calculated based on the following:

- Inline styles: 1000 points
- IDs: 100 points
- Classes, pseudo-classes, and attributes: 10 points
- Elements and pseudo-elements: 1 point

For example, the specificity of `#header .menu li` is 121 (100 for ID, 10 for class, and 1 for element).

## What are Box properties in CSS

Box properties in CSS refer to the box model, which describes how elements are structured and spaced in a layout. The box model consists of:

- **Content**: The actual content of the box (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: A line surrounding the padding and content.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, separating the element from others.

Understanding the box model is essential for effective layout design.
