AirBnB clone-The console

About the project
The project is a simple clone of the AirBnB website. In its first stage, the focus is on building a backend interface, functioning like a command-line console. Through this console, data management is handled by allowing the creation, updating, and deletion of objects, along with file storage management. The primary goal is to establish a system that efficiently manages the program's data via these commands.

Tasks
Implement a parent class called BaseModel to handle initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future object instances.
Establish a simple workflow for the serialization and deserialization process: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.
Develop all necessary classes for the AirBnB project (e.g., User, State, City, Place), ensuring they inherit from BaseModel.
Design and implement the project's first storage engine, which will use file-based storage.
Create comprehensive unittests to ensure that all classes and the storage engine function correctly.
