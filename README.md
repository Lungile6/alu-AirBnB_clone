# AirBnB Clone

## Overview

AirBnB is a comprehensive web application designed to replicate the functionality of the popular rental platform, AirBnB. This project aims to integrate various components, including database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing, to create a fully functional clone.

### Current Status

As of now, the project primarily implements the back-end console, allowing users to interact with the application through a command-line interface. The following features are still in development:

- **Database Storage**: Integration of a database to store and manage user data and listings (not yet implemented).
- **Back-End API**: Development of a RESTful API to handle client requests and facilitate communication between the front end and the back end (not yet implemented).
- **Front-End Interface**: Creation of a user-friendly front-end to enable seamless interaction with the application (not yet implemented).

### Features

- **Command-Line Interface**: The current implementation includes a console that allows for basic operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting listings.
- **Modular Structure**: The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and maintain as new features are added.
